# Design-of-Canonical-LR-Parser
A canonical LR parser or LR(1) parser is an LR(k) parser for k=1, i.e. with a single  lookahead terminal. The special attribute of this parser is that any LR(k) grammar with k>1  can be transformed into an LR(1) grammar.[1] However, back-substitutions are required to  reduce k and as back-substitutions increase, the grammar can quickly become large,  repetitive and hard to understand. LR(k) can handle all deterministic context-free  languages.[1] In the past this LR(k) parser has been avoided because of its huge memory  requirements in favor of less powerful alternatives such as the LALR and the LL(1) parser.  Recently, however, a "minimal LR(1) parser" whose space requirements are close to LALR  parsers[citation needed], is being offered by several parser generators.
